/**
 *
 * A group of objects that receives a shared animation state.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * 	-	Add objects you would otherwise pass as 'root' to the
 * 		constructor or the .clipAction method of AnimationMixer.
 *
 * 	-	Instead pass this object as 'root'.
 *
 * 	-	You can also add and remove objects later when the mixer
 * 		is running.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *  	Objects of this class appear as one object to the mixer,
 *  	so cache control of the individual objects must be done
 *  	on the group.
 *
 * Limitation:
 *
 * 	- 	The animated properties must be compatible among the
 * 		all objects in the group.
 *
 *  -	A single property can either be controlled through a
 *  	target group or directly, but not both.
